# SQL-Pizza-Sales-Analysis

Project Overview:

This project utilizes SQL to analyze a dataset of pizza sales, aiming to discover valuable insights into sales operations. This includes customer segmentation, trends, artist effectiveness, customer interests, expenditure patterns, and revenue growth.

Project Objectives:

- Evaluate the performance of different pizza categories.
- Understand peak order times and customer interests.
- Gather information on average daily sales.
- Extract valuable insights from pizza sales data.

Features:

- Database Creation: Scripts for creating and initializing the database.
- Complex Queries: Advanced SQL queries, including joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- Data Analysis: Analytical queries to derive insights from the data.
- Window Functions: Implementation of window functions.


Database Structure:
The project database consists of several tables. Below is an overview of the primary tables:

- Orders: Records of customer orders.
- Pizza_Type: Information about pizza categories and types.
- Pizzas: Details of available pizzas.
- Order_details: Specifics of items within an order.


The main queries we are looking at are:

1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.
6. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
7. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
8. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
9. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
10. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.
11. Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.
12. Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.
13. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.

Recommendations:

1. Stock Management:

Focus on stock adjustment during the busiest hours (12 PM to 1 PM) to ensure sufficient ingredients for popular pizzas, avoiding shortages.

2. Promotions:

Promote high-revenue pizzas like Barbecue Chicken, Thai Chicken, and California Chicken by offering special deals and discounts.

3. Off-Peak Strategies:

Introduce "Combo Meal Deals" during off-peak hours to stimulate sales volume.
Offer discounts on slow-selling items to increase their sales.

4. Morning Offers:

Provide special offers or waive delivery charges during morning hours (9 AM to 10 AM) to increase sales. Additionally, consider selling pizza slices individually for breakfast.
